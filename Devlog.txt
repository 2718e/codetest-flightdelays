1) What queries would be needed to produce the graphs - what database would support them.

Task is

"create an application that helps users decide on what day
and at what time of day a flight should be booked at in order to avoid
delays for a given pair of origin and destination airports"

2) interpreting this as user will be required to
- select a pair of airports, then graphs will be shown

"A bar chart of the flight delays" - Question - what precisely is "the flight delays" - 
should this graph be number of flights that were delayed by hour? (time period) if so would that 
not artificially make times with more total flights look better.

"a bar chart of the flight delay ratios" - IS this a bar of how many flights vs delay ratio in various bands,
or average delay ratio vs day and hour

Need to ask this. However in terms of database choice that means ideally the database should support

- filtering by equality and comparison
- grouping on equality and comparison
- aggregate functions on groups, and overall.

The usual choice for working with node seems to be mongo => google what this supports.
